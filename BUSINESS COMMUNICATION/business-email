Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Gomolemoo Mogwasi, and I am a final-year student pursuing a Diploma in Information and Communication Technology at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). I am writing to express my keen interest in a graduate internship opportunity at TechNova Solutions, as I greatly admire your company’s innovative contributions to the South African tech industry.

Throughout my studies, I have developed strong foundational skills in programming (including Python and Java), database management, web development, and IT support. I have also completed several team-based projects that required problem-solving, clear communication, and adherence to deadlines—qualities I understand are essential at TechNova.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to contribute to your team while further developing my professional competencies in a real-world environment. I have attached my CV for your reference and would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills align with your internship programme.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your organisation.

Kind regards,
Gomolemo Mogwasi
