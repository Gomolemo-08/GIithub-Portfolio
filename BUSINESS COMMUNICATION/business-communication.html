      <h2>Reflection (STAR Technique)</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Situation:</strong> As part of my work readiness training in PRP370S, I was tasked with developing professional communication skills essential for the ICT workplace. One key activity involved drafting formal correspondence to potential employers.<br><br>
        <strong>Task:</strong> I needed to compose a clear, concise, and professional email to express interest in a graduate internship, ensuring it reflected my qualifications, enthusiasm, and understanding of business etiquette.<br><br>
        <strong>Action:</strong> I researched standard business email structures and reviewed examples of effective outreach messages. I carefully crafted a subject line, used a formal salutation, introduced myself with relevant academic context, highlighted key technical skills, and maintained a respectful and confident tone throughout. I also proofread for grammar, clarity, and formatting before finalising the draft.<br><br>
        <strong>Result:</strong> This exercise significantly improved my ability to communicate professionally in writing. I learned that tone, structure, and attention to detail are critical in making a strong first impression. My lecturer provided feedback that my email was well-organised and appropriate for a corporate setting. This experience has prepared me to confidently engage with future employers through written communication.
