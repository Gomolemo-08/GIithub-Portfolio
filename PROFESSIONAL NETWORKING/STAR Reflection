Situation:
At the start of my PRP370S module, I had no professional online presence and limited understanding of how to build industry connections as a student.

Task:
I needed to establish a foundation for professional networking to support my transition from academia to the ICT workplace.

Action:
I created a LinkedIn profile with a clear headline, professional photo (simulated for this exercise), and a concise summary of my skills and goals. 
I researched how ICT professionals present themselves online and followed companies and alumni in my field. 
I also learned about the importance of engaging respectfully such as personalising connection requests and avoiding spammy behaviour.

Result:
This exercise taught me that networking isn’t just about meeting people it’s about building a professional identity and showing genuine interest in the industry. 
I now understand how platforms like LinkedIn can open doors to internships and mentorship.
Although I haven’t secured a job yet, I feel more confident initiating professional conversations and presenting myself as a capable future ICT practitioner.
