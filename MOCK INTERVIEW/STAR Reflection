Situation:
As part of my PRP370S work readiness training, I participated in a simulated job interview to prepare for real-world graduate opportunities in the ICT sector.

Task:
I needed to demonstrate professional communication, technical awareness, and self-confidence while answering common behavioural and technical interview questions.

Action:
Before the mock interview, I researched typical ICT internship questions, reviewed my projects, and practiced responses using the STAR method. 
During the session, I focused on speaking clearly, maintaining eye contact (even in a simulated setting), and structuring my answers to highlight relevant skills. 
I also prepared thoughtful questions to ask the “interviewer.”

Result:
The experience revealed areas for improvement—such as speaking more concisely but also boosted my confidence.
I learned that preparation reduces anxiety and helps me articulate my value effectively. 
My lecturer noted that my answers were relevant and well-structured. This practice has made me feel significantly more ready for actual job interviews.
