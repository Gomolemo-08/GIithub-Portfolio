As part of my work readiness training, I developed this checklist to guide my professional conduct in an ICT workplace:

✅ Punctuality & Reliability
Arrive on time for work, meetings, and deadlines.
Notify supervisor in advance if absent or delayed.

✅ Professional Communication
Use clear, respectful language in emails and messages.
Avoid slang, emojis, or informal tone in work correspondence.
Respond to messages within a reasonable timeframe.

✅ Dress Code & Presentation
Follow company dress policy (e.g., business casual or uniform).
Maintain neat, clean appearance.

✅ Digital & Online Conduct
Use work devices/accounts for professional purposes only.
Do not share confidential information or internal tools publicly.
Be mindful of tone in virtual meetings (mute when not speaking, use video if required).

✅ Team Collaboration
Listen actively and respect diverse viewpoints.
Give credit to teammates for shared work.
Avoid gossip or negative talk about colleagues.

✅ Workspace Respect
Keep shared areas clean (e.g., desks, kitchens).
Use shared equipment responsibly.

✅ Continuous Learning Attitude
Ask questions when unsure.
Accept feedback gracefully and act on it.

This checklist is based on principles discussed in PRP370S and industry best practices for entry-level ICT professionals.
