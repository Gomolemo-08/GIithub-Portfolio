Situation:
During my PRP370S work readiness module, I realised that technical skills alone are not enough to succeed in the workplace—professional behaviour is equally important, especially in team-based ICT environments.

Task:
I needed to understand and internalise key principles of workplace etiquette to ensure I represent myself and my future employer appropriately.

Action:
I reviewed guidelines on professional conduct, observed examples of effective workplace communication, and created a personal etiquette checklist covering punctuality, digital communication, dress code, and collaboration.
I also reflected on past group project experiences where miscommunication or lateness caused delays, and considered how better etiquette could have improved outcomes.

Result:
This exercise helped me see that small actions—like replying promptly to an email or dressing appropriately—build trust and credibility.
I now understand that being “professional” means consistency in reliability, respect, and attitude. I plan to use this checklist during my internship to hold myself accountable and make a positive impression from day one.
