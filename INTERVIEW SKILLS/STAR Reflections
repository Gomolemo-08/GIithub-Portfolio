Situation:
During my PRP370S work readiness module, I realised I lacked a professional CV to use in job applications and interviews, despite having relevant academic and project experience.

Task:
I needed to create a concise, well-structured CV that highlights my technical skills, education, and project work in a way that appeals to ICT employers.

Action:
I researched CV best practices for IT graduates, reviewed examples from CPUT career services, and identified my key strengths and projects. 
I organised my information clearly under headings like Education, Skills, and Projects, ensuring relevance to entry-level ICT roles. 
I also asked a peer to review it for clarity and errors.

Result:
Completing this CV gave me confidence in presenting my qualifications during interviews. 
I now understand how to tailor my experience to employer needs and articulate my value.
This document has become a foundational tool in my job search, and I plan to update it regularly as I gain more experience.
